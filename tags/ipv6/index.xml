      <description>I had been playing with IPv6 on various systems in early 2000s. They were mostly NetBSD (1.x) and FreeBSD (4.x) plus Windows XP. My home network had been connected to the IPv6 Internet with a router running NetBSD/hpcmips which was installed on a Windows CE handheld PC.
After a decade and a half, I decided to reconnect my home network to the IPv6 Internet.
Unfortunately, native IPv6 service is still unavailable for me.</description>
