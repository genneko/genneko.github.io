      <title>Expanding a GELI-encrypted ZFS pool</title>

      <description>My personal FreeBSD 11.3 server (VPS) was running low on storage space.
By using the VPS provider&#39;s disk expansion option, I could easily grow the virtual disk.
But then I wondered how to expand the filesystem on it.
In my case, the filesystem is on a GELI-encrypted ZFS storage pool.
So I had to resize the following entities.
 GPT freebsd-zfs partition GELI device on the GPT partition ZFS pool comprised of the GELI device  After rehearsing on VirtualBox VMs, I took the following steps to get more free space for the server.</description>

      <title>Growing a ZFS Mirror Pool</title>

      <description>I have a tiny home server for my family. It&#39;s based on Atom N2800 CPU and runs FreeBSD 11.2 with a two-disk ZFS mirror.
Originally it had two 500GB disks, but now it has a 500GB and a 1TB ones because one of them was replaced due to a failure.
As the Handbook says, the available space of a mirror pool is limited by the size of the smallest disk. So my server can still get only 500GB from the total space of 1.</description>

      <title>Mounting ZFS Root failed when an external USB drive is connected</title>

      <description>Last week, one of my FreeBSD 11.2 servers failed to boot with the following error after freebsd-update.
Mounting from zfs:zroot/ROOT/default failed with error 6; retrying for 3 more seconds It was the first time I encountered this type of error.
After struggling for some hours, I was able to boot the server by disconnecting an external USB harddrive, which I had prepared as a secondary backup storage. But since then, I had been wondering what the root cause was.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Temporary Storage with GELI</title>

      <description>Recently, I wanted an encrypted working directory on a running FreeBSD system. The system was running on a plain (unencrypted) ZFS pool and there&#39;s no plan to add disks to it. I needed the working directory only temporarily.
I came up with the following options.
 Use GELI on a ZFS volume (zvol). Use GELI on a memory disk (md). Use PEFS on a directory.  I excluded PEFS because I had very little experience.</description>

      <title>Migrating a live system from GEOM mirror to ZFS mirror</title>

      <description>I had been wanting to migrate a FreeBSD system on a GEOM mirror (gmirror) to a ZFS mirror.
After several rehearsals on a VM, I have finally achieved that goal with the following steps.
  Load ZFS-releated kernel modules and set a tunable to use 4K sector drives.
sudo kldload zfs sudo sysctl vfs.zfs.min_auto_ashift=12 ``
  Remove one (da0) of the two disks (da0, da1) which make up the gmirror (gm0).</description>
