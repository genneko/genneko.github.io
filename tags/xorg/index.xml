      <description>FreeBSD jails are often talked about from a security or system administration perspective.
Although it&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly valid point of view, jails can also be used for other purposes.
In fact, just recently I benefited from a jail in such a situation.
It once again convinced me that jails were really awesome and made me write up this short article.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using FreeBSD as my primary server OS for quite a long time.
But, for unknown reasons, I have never seriously used it on client workstations.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s partly because I&amp;rsquo;m a CUI-oriented person who loves doing things on text terminals as much as possible.
Actually, I have been pretty happy with any client OS as long as I could use a decent terminal on it, so that I could SSH into FreeBSD servers where I spent a lot of time doing jobs which didn&amp;rsquo;t require graphical interface.</description>
