      <description>I&#39;ve been using FreeBSD as my primary server OS for quite a long time.
But, for unknown reasons, I have never seriously used it on client workstations.
Maybe it&#39;s partly because I&#39;m a CUI-oriented person who loves doing things on text terminals as much as possible.
Actually, I have been pretty happy with any client OS as long as I could use a decent terminal on it, so that I could SSH into FreeBSD servers where I spent a lot of time doing jobs which didn&#39;t require graphical interface.</description>
