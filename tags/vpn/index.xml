      <description>After playing briefly with WireGuard (See previous post) on FreeBSD VNET Jails, today I performed a quick test between a FreeBSD host and an Android device over the Internet.
NOTE: WireGuard is still in early stage of development. Android app is clearly marked with beta and Go-implementation (wireguard-go) has no official release yet. This article just shows you what I did to take a look at it.

      <description>WireGuard is a new VPN application which focuses on simplicity thus security and speed. Although it was initially developed as a Linux kernel feature, now it has a userspace implementation in Go and binary packages are available for FreeBSD.
I used this weekend to have a quick look at it on FreeBSD 12.0.
This time I focused on site-to-site VPN setup. Maybe I will try remote-access VPN configuration in the near future.</description>

      <description>I have managed to setup route-based IPsec VPN with FreeBSD-11.1 RC3, which had introduced ipsec virtual tunnel interface if_ipsec(4). Here is a record of my experiment just for your information.
Prerequisite  FreeBSD-11.1-RC3/amd64 Generic kernel No special packages/ports (just added sudo and a few other must-have utilities)  Network configuration NOTE: The following text shows bsd1 configurations only.
 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 192.168.10.0/24 --- [bsd1] ----- /// ----- [bsd2] --- 192.</description>
