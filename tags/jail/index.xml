      <description>FreeBSD jails are often talked about from a security or system administration perspective.
Although it&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly valid point of view, jails can also be used for other purposes.

It once again convinced me that jails were really awesome and I&amp;rsquo;d like to write up this short article.
Assumptions  The host is a graphical desktop workstation running FreeBSD 12.</description>

      <description>I have heard about jails many times since my early days of FreeBSD life but it was only the last year I began to use it in production.
This article is a sort of personal notebook where I summarize what I learned about jails. It would be frequently updated as I learn more.
Assumptions  The host is running FreeBSD 11.2/amd64 on ZFS. Each jail has a separate root dataset under /vm on the host.</description>
