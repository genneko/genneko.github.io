      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using FreeBSD as my primary server OS for quite a long time.
But, for unknown reasons, I have never seriously used it on client workstations.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s partly because I&amp;rsquo;m a CUI-oriented person who loves doing things on text terminals as much as possible.
Actually, I have been pretty happy with any client OS as long as I could use a decent terminal on it, so that I could SSH into FreeBSD servers where I spent a lot of time doing jobs which didn&amp;rsquo;t require graphical interface.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Evernote since April 2011.
Although there were times the app got disappointing updates or the service was unexpectedly interrupted (or more often expectedly interrupted by regular maintenance), it had been a great app/service and hopefully it is and it will be.
Looking at the sorted note list on its web application, I found my first note had a date of 2011-04-24 and it was about Android browser&amp;rsquo;s local file handling.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been so busy for the last month that I almost forgot about FreeBSD 12.0 which I had been looking forward to. Now it&amp;rsquo;s just around the corner!
Although it&amp;rsquo;s quite late, I tried to install 12.0-RC3 on a host behind a HTTP proxy and found that using a bootonly installer in this environment was a bit tricky. The following are the steps I took.
 Boot the host with a bootonly installer.</description>
