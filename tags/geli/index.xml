      <description>My personal FreeBSD 11.3 server (VPS) was running low on storage space.
By using the VPS provider&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;scale-up&amp;rdquo; option, I could easily grow the virtual disk.
But then I wondered how to expand the filesystem on it.
In my case, the filesystem is on a GELI-encrypted ZFS storage pool.
So I had to resize the following entities.
 GPT freebsd-zfs partition GELI device on the GPT partition ZFS pool comprised of the GELI device  After rehearsing on VirtualBox VMs, I took the following steps to get more free space for the server.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Temporary Storage with GELI</title>

      <description>Recently, I wanted an encrypted working directory on a running FreeBSD system. The system was running on a plain (unencrypted) ZFS pool and there&amp;rsquo;s no plan to add disks to it. I needed the working directory only temporarily.
I came up with the following options.
 Use GELI on a ZFS volume (zvol). Use GELI on a memory disk (md). Use PEFS on a directory.  I excluded PEFS because I had very little experience.</description>
