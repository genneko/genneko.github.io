      <description>After playing briefly with WireGuard (See previous post) on FreeBSD VNET Jails, today I performed a quick test between a FreeBSD host and an Android device over the Internet.
NOTE: WireGuard is still in early stage of development. Android app is clearly marked with beta and Go-implementation (wireguard-go) has no official release yet. This article just shows you what I did to take a look at it.

      <description>WireGuard is a new VPN application which focuses on simplicity thus security and speed. Although it was initially developed as a Linux kernel feature, now it has a userspace implementation in Go and binary packages are available for FreeBSD.
I used this weekend to have a quick look at it on FreeBSD 12.0.
This time I focused on site-to-site VPN setup. Maybe I will try remote-access VPN configuration in the near future.</description>
