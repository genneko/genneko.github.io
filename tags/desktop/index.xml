      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using FreeBSD as my primary server OS for quite a long time.
But, for unknown reasons, I have never seriously used it on client workstations.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s partly because I&amp;rsquo;m a CUI-oriented person who loves doing things on text terminals as much as possible.
Actually, I have been pretty happy with any client OS as long as I could use a decent terminal on it, so that I could SSH into FreeBSD servers where I spent a lot of time doing jobs which didn&amp;rsquo;t require graphical interface.</description>
