      <description>I&#39;ve been using Evernote since April 2011.
Although there were times the app got disappointing updates or the service was unexpectedly interrupted (or more often expectedly interrupted by regular maintenance), it had been a great app/service and hopefully it is and it will be.
Looking at the sorted note list on its web application, I found my first note had a date of 2011-04-24 and it was about Android browser&#39;s local file handling.</description>
